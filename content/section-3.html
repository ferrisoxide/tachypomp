THE MAN WITHOUT A BODY

On a shelf in the old Arsenal Museum, in the Central Park, in the
midst of stuffed hummingbirds, ermines, silver foxes, and bright-
colored parakeets, there is a ghastly row of human heads. I pass by
the mummied Peruvian, the Maori chief, and the Flathead Indian to
speak of a Caucasian head which has had a fascinating interest to me
ever since it was added to the grim collection a little more than a
year ago.

I was struck with the Head when I first saw it. The pensive
intelligence of the features won me. The face is remarkable, although
the nose is gone, and the nasal fossae are somewhat the worse for
wear. The eyes are likewise wanting, but the empty orbs have an
expression of their own. The parchmenty skin is so shriveled that the
teeth show to their roots in the jaws. The mouth has been much
affected by the ravages of decay, but what mouth there is displays
character. It seems to say: "Barring certain deficiencies in my
anatomy, you behold a man of parts!" The features of the Head are of
the Teutonic cast, and the skull is the skull of a philosopher. What
particularly attracted my attention, however, was the vague
resemblance which this dilapidated countenance bore to some face which
had at some time been familiar to me--some face which lingered in my
memory, but which I could not place.

After all, I was not greatly surprised, when I had known the Head for
nearly a year, to see it acknowledge our acquaintance and express its
appreciation of friendly interest on my part by deliberately winking
at me as I stood before its glass case.

This was on a Trustees' Day, and I was the only visitor in the hall.
The faithful attendant had gone to enjoy a can of beer with his
friend, the superintendent of the monkeys.

The Head winked a second time, and even more cordially than before. I
gazed upon its efforts with the critical delight of an anatomist. I
saw the masseter muscle flex beneath the leathery skin. I saw the play
of the glutinators, and the beautiful lateral movement of the internal
playtsyma. I knew the Head was trying to speak to me. I noted the
convulsive twitchings of the risorius and the zygomatie major, and
knew that it was endeavoring to smile.

"Here," I thought, "is either a case of vitality long after
decapitation, or, an instance of reflex action where there is no
diastaltic or excitor-motory system. In either case the phenomenon is
unprecedented, and should be carefully observed. Besides, the Head is
evidently well disposed toward me." I found a key on my bunch which
opened the glass door.

"Thanks," said the Head. "A breath of fresh air is quite a treat."

"How do you feel?" I asked politely. "How does it seem without a
body?"

The Head shook itself sadly and sighed. "I would give," it said,
speaking through its ruined nose, and for obvious reasons using chest
tones sparingly, "I would give both ears for a single leg. My ambition
is principally ambulatory, and yet I cannot walk. I cannot even hop or
waddle. I would fain travel, roam, promenade, circulate in the busy
paths of men, but I am chained to this accursed shelf. I am no better
off than these barbarian heads--I, a man of science! I am compelled to
sit here on my neck and see sandpipers and storks all around me, with
legs and to spare. Look at that infernal little Oedieneninus longpipes
over there. Look at that miserable gray-headed porphyric. They have no
brains, no ambition, no yearnings. Yet they have legs, legs, legs, in
profusion." He cast an envious glance across the alcove at the
tantalizing limbs of the birds in question and added gloomily, "There
isn't even enough of me to make a hero for one of Wilkie Collins's
novels."

I did not exactly know how to console him in so delicate a manner, but
ventured to hint that perhaps his condition had its compensations in
immunity from corns and the gout.

"And as to arms," he went on, "there's another misfortune for you! I
am unable to brush away the flies that get in here--Lord knows how--in
the summertime. I cannot reach over and cuff that confounded Chinook
mummy that sits there grinning at me like a jack-in-the-box. I cannot
scratch my head or even blow my nose (his nose!) decently when I get
cold in this thundering draft. As to eating and drinking, I don't
care. My soul is wrapped up in science. Science is my bride, my
divinity. I worship her footsteps in the past and hail the prophecy of
her future progress. I-"

I had heard these sentiments before. In a flash I had accounted for
the familiar look which had haunted me ever since I first saw the
Head. "Pardon me," I said, "you are the celebrated Professor
Dummkopf?"

"That is, or was, my name," he replied, with dignity.

"And you formerly lived in Boston, where you carried on scientific
experiments of startling originality. It was you who first discovered
how to photograph smell, how to bottle music, how to freeze the aurora
borealis. It was you who first applied spectrW analysis to Mind."

"Those were some of my minor achievements," said the Head, sadly
nodding itself--"small when compared with my final invention, the
grand discovery which was at the same time my greatest triumph and my
ruin. I lost my Body in an experiment."

"How was that?" I asked. "I had not heard."

"No," said the Head. "I being alone and friendless, my disappearance
was hardly noticed. I will tell you."

There was a sound upon the stairway. "Hush!" cried the Head. "Here
comes somebody. We must not be discovered. You must dissemble."

I hastily closed the door of the glass case, locking it just in time
to evade the vigilance of the returning keeper, and dissembled by
pretending to examine, with great interest, a nearby exhibit.

On the next Trustees' Day I revisited the museum and gave the keeper
of the Head a dollar on the pretense of purchasing information in
regard to the curiosities in his charge. He made the circuit of the
hall with me, talking volubly all the while.

"That there," he said, as we stood before the Head, "is a relic of
morality presented to the museum fifteen months ago. The head of a
notorious murderer guillotined at Paris in the last century, sir."

I fancied that I saw a slight twitching about the corners of Professor
Dummkopf's mouth and an almost imperceptible depression of what was
once his left eyelid, but he kept his face remarkably well under the
circumstances. I dismissed my guide with many thanks for his
intelligent services, and, as I had anticipated, he departed forthwith
to invest his easily earned dollar in beer, leaving me to pursue my
conversation with the Head.

"Think of putting a wooden-headed idiot like that," said the
professor, after I had opened his glass prison, "in charge of a
portion, however small, of a man of science--of the inventor of the
Telepomp! Paris! Murderer! Last century, indeed!" and the Head shook
with laughter until I feared that it would tumble off the shelf.

"You spoke of your invention, the Telepomp," I suggested.

"Ah, yes," said the Head, simultaneously recovering its gravity and
its center of gravity; "I promised to tell you how I happen to be a
Man without a Body. You see that some three or four years ago I
discovered the principle of the transmission of sound by electricity.
My telephone, as I called it, would have been an invention of great
practical utility if I had been spared to introduce it to the public.
But, alas-"

"Excuse the interruption," I said, "but I must inform you that
somebody else has recently accomplished the same thing. The telephone
is a realized fact."

"Have they gone any further?" he eagerly asked. "Have they discovered
the great secret of the transmission of atoms? In other words, have
they accomplished the Telepomp?"

"I have heard nothing of the kind," I hastened to assure him, "but
what do you mean?"

"Listen," he said. "In the course of my experiments with the telephone
I became convinced that the same principle was capable of indefinite
expansion. Matter is made up of molecules, and molecules, in their
turn, are made up of atoms. The atom, you know, is the unit of being.
The molecules differ according to the number and the arrangement of
their constituent atoms. Chemical changes are effected by the
dissolution of the atoms in the molecules and their rearrangements
into molecules of another kind. This dissolution may be accomplished
by chemical affinity or by a sufficiently strong electric current. Do
you follow me?"

"Perfectly."

"Well, then, following out this line of thought, I conceived a great
idea. There was no reason why matter could not be telegraphed, or, to
be etymologically accurate, 'telepomped.' It was only necessary to
effect at one end of the line the disintegration of the molecules into
atoms and to convey the vibrations of the chemical dissolution by
electricity to the other pole, where a corresponding reconstruction
could be effected from other atoms. As all atoms are alike, their
arrangement into molecules of the same order, and the arrangement of
those molecules into an organization similar to the original
organization, would be practically a reproduction of the original. It
would be a materialization--not in the sense of the spiritualists'
cant, but in all the truth and logic of stern science. Do you still
follow me?"

"It is a little misty," I said, "but I think I get the point. You
would telegraph the Idea of the matter, to use the word Idea in
Plato's sense."

"Precisely. A candle flame is the same candle flame although the
burning gas is continually changing. A wave on the surface of water is
the same wave, although the water composing it is shifting as it
moves. A man is the same man although there is not an atom in his body
which was there five years before. It is the form, the shape, the
Idea, that is essential. The vibrations that give individuality to
matter may be transmitted to a distance by wire just as readily as the
vibrations that give individuality to sound. So I constructed an
instrument by which I could pull down matter, so to speak, at the
anode and build it up again on the same plan at the cathode. This was
my Telepomp."

"But in practice--how did the Telepomp work?"

"To perfection! In my rooms on joy Street, in Boston, I had about five
miles of wire. I had no difficulty in sending simple compounds, such
as quartz, starch, and water, from one room to another over this five-
mile coil. I shall never forget the joy with which I disintegrated a
three-cent postage stamp in one room and found it immediately
reproduced at the receiving instrument in another. This success with
inorganic matter emboldened me to attempt the same thing with a living
organism. I caught a cat--a black and yellow cat--and I submitted him
to a terrible current from my two-hundred-cup battery. The cat
disappeared in a twinkling. I hastened to the next room and, to my
immense satisfaction, found Thomas there, alive and purring, although
somewhat astonished. It worked like a charm."

"This is certainly very remarkable."

"Isn't it? After my experiment with the cat, a gigantic idea took
possession of me. If I could send a feline being, why not send a human
being? If I could transmit a cat five miles by wire in an instant by
electricity, why not transmit a man to London by Atlantic cable and
with equal dispatch? I resolved to strengthen my already powerful
battery and try the experiment. Like a thorough votary of science, I
resolved to try the experiment on myself.

"I do not like to dwell upon this chapter of my experience," continued
the Head, winking at a tear which had trickled down on to his cheek
and which I gently wiped away for him with my own pocket handkerchief.
"Suffice it that I trebled the cups in my battery, stretched my wire
over housetops to my lodgings in Phillips Street, made everything
ready, and with a solemn calmness born of my confidence in the theory,
placed myself in the receiving instrument of the Telepomp at my Joy
Street office. I was as sure that when I made the connection with the
battery I would find myself in my rooms in Phillips Street as I was
sure of my existence. Then I touched the key that let on the
electricity. Alas!"

For some moments my friend was unable to speak. At last, with an
effort, he resumed his narrative.

"I began to disintegrate at my feet and slowly disappeared under my
own eyes. My legs melted away, and then my trunk and arms. That
something was wrong, I knew from the exceeding slowness of my
dissolution, but I was helpless. Then my head went and I lost all
consciousness. According to my theory, my head, having been the last
to disappear, should have been the first to materialize at the other
end of the wire. The theory was confirmed in fact. I recovered
consciousness. I opened my eyes in my Phillips Street apartments. My
chin was materializing, and with great satisfaction I saw my neck
slowly taking shape. Suddenly, and about at the third cervical
vertebra, the process stopped. In a flash I knew the reason. I had
forgotten to replenish the cups of my battery with fresh sulphuric
acid, and there was not electricity enough to materialize the rest of
me. I was a Head, but my body was Lord knows where."

I did not attempt to offer consolation. Words would have been mockery
in the presence of Professor Dummkopf's grief.

"What matters it about the rest?" he sadly continued. "The house in
Phillips Street was full of medical students. I suppose that some of
them found my head, and knowing nothing of me or of the Telepomp,
appropriated it for purposes of anatomical study. I suppose that they
attempted to preserve it by means of some arsenical preparation. How
badly the work was done is shown by my defective nose. I suppose that
I drifted from medical student to medical student and from anatomical
cabinet to anatomical cabinet until some would-be humorist presented
me to this collection as a French murderer of the last century. For
some months I knew nothing, and when I recovered consciousness I found
myself here.

"Such," added the Head, with a dry, harsh laugh, "is the irony of
fate!"

"Is there nothing I can do for you?" I asked, after a pause.

"Thank you," the Head replied; "I am tolerably cheerful and resigned.
I have lost pretty much all interest in experimental science. I sit
here day after day and watch the objects of zoological,
ichthyological, ethnological, and conchological interest with which
this admirable museum abounds. I don't know of anything you can do for
me.

"Stay," he added, as his gaze fell once more upon the exasperating
legs of the Oedienenius longpipes opposite him. "If there is anything
I do feel the need of, it is outdoor exercise. Couldn't you manage in
some way to take me out for a walk?"

I confess that I was somewhat staggered by this request, but promised
to do what I could. After some deliberation, I formed a plan, which
was carried out in the following manner:

I returned to the museum that afternoon just before the closing hour,
and hid myself behind the mammoth sea cow, or Manatus Americanus. The
attendant, after a cursory glance through the hall, locked up the
building and departed. Then I came boldly forth and removed my friend
from his shelf. With a piece of stout twine, I lashed his one or two
vertebrae to the headless vertebrae of a skeleton moa. This gigantic
and extinct bird of New Zealand is heavy-legged, full-breasted, tall
as a man, and has huge, sprawling feet. My friend, thus provided with
legs and arms, manifested extraordinary glee. He walked about, stamped
his big feet, swung his wings, and occasionally broke forth into a
hilarious shuffle. I was obliged to remind him that he must support
the dignity of the venerable bird whose skeleton he had borrowed. I
despoiled the African lion of his glass eyes, and inserted them in the
empty orbits of the Head. I gave Professor Dummkopf a Fiji war lance
for a walking stick, covered him with a Sioux blanket, and then we
issued forth from the old arsenal into the fresh night air and the
moonlight, and wandered arm in arm along the shores of the quiet lake
and through the mazy paths of the Ramble.
